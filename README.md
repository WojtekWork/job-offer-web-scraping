You work in a team as a data analyst. Your daily duties include acquiring, storing and interpreting data and making recommendations based on it.

As the tasks are increasing, it has been decided that new people are to be hired for the following positions:

data analyst,
data engineer,
data scientist
in order to more efficiently provide recommendations to the internal customer.

The HR team has asked your boss to provide the following information:

what is the estimated expense of hiring such people,
what the ranges of each offer should be,
in which cities such people can be hired,
whether it is possible for a team to be established in one city.
Employment offers are to appear on the nofluffjobs website, and she is to be used as the basis for the analysis.

The project is carried out as part of the specialized Data Lab course from CodersLab
